                <b>NOTE: </b>Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities.

                Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition,[1] moderate-vigorous physical exercise,[2]
                 and sufficient rest along with a formal recovery plan.[3] Before the Industrial Revolution, fitness was defined 
                 as the capacity to carry out the day's activities without undue fatigue or lethargy<sup>2</sup>, resulting from
                  mass in kilograms and height in metres.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, with automation and changes in lifestyles, physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body's ability
                 to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, 
                 improve immune system and to meet emergency situations.

                Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and healthy.[5] Around 1950, perhaps consistent with the Industrial 
                Revolution and the treatise of World War II, the term "fitness" increased in western vernacular by a factor of ten.[6] The 
                modern definition of fitness describes either a person or machine's ability to perform a specific function or a holistic
                 definition of human adaptability to cope with various situations.

            <p style="margin-top: 5%;">
                This has led to an interrelation of human fitness and physical attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness
                 equipment industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant aerobic or anaerobic 
                 ability (i.e., endurance or strength). A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of fitness compared to practicing
                  only one, such as only cardio/respiratory or only weight training.

                In the 1940s, an emigrant M.D. from Austria named Hans Kraus began testing children in the U.S. and Europe for what he termed, "Muscular 
                Fitness." (in other words, muscular functionality) Through his testing, he found children in the U.S. to be far less physically capable 
                than European children. Kraus published some alarming papers in various journals and got the attention of some powerful people, including 
                a senator from Pennsylvania who took the findings to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. President Eisenhower was "shocked." He set up a series 
                of conferences and committees; then in July 1956, Eisenhower established the President's Council on Youth Fitness.

               In Greece, physical fitness was considered to be an essential component of a healthy life and it was the norm for men to frequent a gymnasium.
                Physical fitness regimes were also considered to be of paramount importance in a nation's ability to train soldiers for an effective military force.
                 Partly for these reasons, organized fitness regimes have been in existence throughout known history and evidence of them can be found in many countries.

                Gymnasiums which would seem familiar today began to become increasingly common in the 19th century. The industrial revolution had led to a more sedentary 
                lifestyle for many people and there was an increased awareness that this had the potential to be harmful to health. This was a key motivating factor for the
                 forming of a physical culture movement, especially in Europe and the USA. This movement advocated increased levels of physical fitness for men, women, and children 
                 and sought to do so through various forms of indoor and outdoor activity, and education. In many ways, it laid the foundations for modern fitness culture
