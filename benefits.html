            <p>Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and
                 boost your endurance. Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients
                  to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more 
                  efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you 
                  have more energy to tackle daily chores.Muscle-strengthening
                   activities like lifting weights can help you increase or maintain 
                   your muscle mass and strength. This is important for older adults
                    who experience reduced muscle mass and muscle strength with aging.
